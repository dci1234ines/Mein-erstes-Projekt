<h2>Jabberwocky</h2>

<p>It was brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.<br>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>

<p>“Beware the <b>Jabberwock</b>, my son!<br>
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
The frumious Bandersnatch!”</p>

<p>He took his vorpal sword in hand.<br>
Long time the manxome foe he sought-<br>
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br>
And stood awhile in thought.</p>

<p>And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
The <b> Jabberwock,</b> with eyes of flame,<br>
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
And burbled as it came!</p>

<p>One, two! And through and through<br>
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
He left it dead, and with its head<br>
He went galumphing back.</p>

<p>
<q>“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”<br>
He chortled in his joy.</q></p>

<p>It was brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.<br>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
